Compelling story / defining moment

Personality

Authoritative and independent, I prefer to work alone because it allows me to ensure that all the work done is perfect and exactly how I envisioned it. In group projects I like to assume a supervisory role. Leadership is a growth area for me, but making sure that everything is done and done right is something I am passionate about.
